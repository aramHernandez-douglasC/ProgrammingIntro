INTRO TO PROGRAMMING AND PYTHON FUNDAMENTALS

Objective: Understand what is python and the fundamentals of programming

Block 1: 
- What is Python?
   - Python is a versatile, high-level programming language used in web development, data science, AI, and more.
   - Python has a simple syntax, making it beginner-friendly, which is why it's used widely in AI and ML development.

- Role of Python in AI & ML
    - Python libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Keras make Python a dominant language in AI.
    - It's the go-to language for data analysis, model building, and deployment.

- What is AI?
    - AI involves building systems that can mimic human cognitive functions like learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

**BINARY OPERATIONS**
- 

Programming is closely linked to binary and bitwise operations, as computers process information in binary form (using 1s and 0s). Hereâ€™s an overview of key concepts:

**Binary System:**

- The binary system is a base-2 numeral system that uses only 0 and 1 to represent data.
- Every piece of data in a computer is ultimately represented in binary (e.g., numbers, text, images, etc.).

Example:
Decimal 5 is 101 in binary.
Decimal 10 is 1010 in binary.

**Bitwise Operators:** 

Bitwise operators perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers.
- AND (&): Compares two bits, returning 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise 0.
    - 5 & 3 â†’ 0101 & 0011 â†’ 0001 (which is 1 in decimal).
- OR (|): Compares two bits, returning 1 if at least one bit is 1.
    - 5 | 3 â†’ 0101 | 0011 â†’ 0111 (which is 7 in decimal).
- XOR (^): Compares two bits, returning 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.
    - 5 ^ 3 â†’ 0101 ^ 0011 â†’ 0110 (which is 6 in decimal).
- NOT (~): Flips the bits. It inverts 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.
    - ~5 â†’ ~0101 â†’ 1010 (which is -6 in decimal due to two's complement representation).

**Truth tables**

âœ… **1. AND (and / &&)**

````
A	B	A and B
0	0	0
0	1	0
1	0	0
1	1	1
````
ðŸ”¹ Only true when both A and B are true.

âœ… **2. OR (or / ||)**

````
A	B	A or B
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	1
````

ðŸ”¹ True when at least one is true.

âœ… **3. NOT (not / !)**

````
A	not A
0	1
1	0
````

ðŸ”¹ Inverts the value.

âœ… **4. XOR (Exclusive OR)**

````
A	B	A XOR B
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	0
````

ðŸ”¹ True only if one is true, but not both.

Shift Operators (<<, >>): These shift the bits left or right.

Left shift (<<) multiplies the number by 2 for each shift.

Right shift (>>) divides the number by 2 for each shift.

Example:

5 << 1 (left shift) â†’ 10 (which is 5 * 2)

5 >> 1 (right shift) â†’ 2 (which is 5 // 2)
