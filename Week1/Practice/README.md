**WEEK 1 RECAP** 
-

Please solve the following exercises. I encourage you to run the code snippet and
play around with it to ensure you fully understand the underlying concept of each
exercise. 

**Reminder**

To run the code on your machine use any of the following commands on your terminal
depending on your specific setup:

``python3 {YOUR_PYTHON_FILENAME}.py``

``py {YOUR_PYTHON_FILENAME}.py``

``python {YOUR_PYTHON_FILENAME}.py``

In case your machine has any trouble running said command, check that you
are running the command on the correct path on your terminal. To change paths in 
windows, linux and mac use:
``cd {FOLFER_PATH_TO_MOVE_TOWARDS}``

and to go backwards

``cd ..``

Also make sure you create your own python file inside this folder to run each of the following code snippets
the goal of doing these exercises is to practice how to debug on your own, skill that 
will be essential further down the road.

Try to solve it as much as you can by yourself unless you are stuck which in case do not 
hesitate contact me via whatsapp or discord at the following channels:
