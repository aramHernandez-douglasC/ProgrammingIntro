**Practice Exercises**
-

Please solve the following exercises. This will be a fully hands on exercise, please try
to solve it by your own as much as you can. Feel free to look for language-specific syntax
online in case you get stuck on which function you will need, however I encourage you to try to 
solve the main logic by yourself.

**Reminder**

To run the code on your machine use any of the following commands on your terminal
depending on your specific setup:

``python3 {YOUR_PYTHON_FILENAME}.py``

``py {YOUR_PYTHON_FILENAME}.py``

``python {YOUR_PYTHON_FILENAME}.py``

In case your machine has any trouble running said command, check that you
are running the command on the correct path on your terminal. To change paths in 
windows, linux and mac use:

``cd {FOLFER_PATH_TO_MOVE_TOWARDS}``

and to go backwards

``cd ..``

Also make sure you create your own python file inside this folder to run each of the following code snippets
the goal of doing these exercises is to practice how to debug on your own, skill that 
will be essential further down the road.

Try to solve it as much as you can by yourself unless you are stuck which in case do not

**Exercises:**
-

Read the following exercises and choose weather you need to make use of a conditional or a
loop to be able to solve them.

**Noob level**

1. Count from 1 to 10
    - Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.

2. Age Group Classifier
    - Ask the user for their age (remember to use function parameters to achieve this).
    - Print:
      - "Child" if under 1
      - "Teen" if 13–17
      - "Adult" if 18+

3. Multiplication Table
    - Ask the user for a number (remember to use function parameters to achieve this)
    - Use a loop to print the multiplication table up to 10
   ```
   # Input: 5 
   # Output: 5x1 = 5, 5x2 = 10, ..., 5x10 = 50
   ```
   
**Meh, not there yet :v**

1. Simple Login System
   - Ask the user to enter a username and password.
   - If username is "admin" and password is "1234", print "Access granted", else "Access denied".

2. Number Guessing Game
   - Create a secret number (e.g., 7)
   - Keep asking the user to guess until they get it right
   - Give hints: “Too high” or “Too low”
   - Show number of attempts when they win


**Master, idolo, bestia de python. Ni el lenguaje se carga un python como tu**

For this section only solve one of the exercises. Choose wisely as one might be easier than the other
but you won't know until you start hehe .

1. Prime Number Finder
   - Ask the user for a number n
   - Print all prime numbers from 2 up to n

   **Reminder: A prime number is any positive natural number greater than 1 that has exactly 2 divisors, 1 and itself.
      One is not considered a prime number because it only has 1 divisor which is only itself.
```
2 is prime since it's only divisible by 1 and 2
3 is prime since it's only divisible by 1 and 3
4 is NOT prime since it's divisible by 1, 2 and 4
```

````
# Input: 10
# Output: 2, 3, 5, 7
````

2. Rock, paper, scissors (vs computer)
   - Ask the user to choose "rock", "paper", or "scissors"
   - Randomly generate the computer's choice
   - Use find a way to determine the winner
   - Rules:
     - Rock beats Scissors
     - Paper beats Rock
     - Scissors beats Paper
   
   **Tip: Use import random and random.choice() for the computer's pick.
